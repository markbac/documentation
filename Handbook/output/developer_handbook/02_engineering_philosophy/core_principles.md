# Core Principles

## Overview

At the heart of our engineering culture are clearly defined core principles: **autonomy**, **mastery**, and **purpose**—supported by **context-driven judgement**. These principles are not just aspirational; they are operational. This page defines what each principle means, why it is important, and how to apply it in practice.

## Autonomy

### Definition

Autonomy means each engineer is trusted with the responsibility to make informed decisions within their area of work. This encompasses technical, process, and organisational choices—provided they align with team objectives and organisational standards.

### Rationale

- **Faster Decision-Making:** Local decisions reduce bottlenecks and enable rapid iteration.
- **Increased Ownership:** When engineers control their work, accountability and engagement improve.
- **Adaptation to Local Context:** Those closest to a problem best understand its nuances.

### Expectations

- **Understand Context:** Before acting autonomously, seek out relevant information—requirements, constraints, existing systems, and team goals.
- **Communicate Proactively:** Share your intentions and progress, especially on decisions that may impact others or carry notable risk.
- **Remain Aligned:** Operate within agreed architectural boundaries, coding standards, and business priorities.

### Practical Example

If you identify a bottleneck in the deployment pipeline, autonomy means you can investigate and trial a technical improvement. However, you should first review any team processes that might be related, notify the team of proposed changes, and ensure that modifications are compatible with shared infrastructure.

## Mastery

### Definition

Mastery is the commitment to technical excellence and continuous personal development. It requires keeping skills current, understanding domain fundamentals, and steadily improving the quality of your work.

### Rationale

- **Technical Quality:** High standards reduce defects and future technical debt.
- **Staying Relevant:** The technology landscape evolves; maintaining expertise ensures you can contribute effectively.
- **Problem-Solving:** Deeper knowledge leads to more robust and innovative solutions.

### Expectations

- **Continuous Learning:** Allocate time to enhance your skills through reading, experimentation, or training.
- **Retrospective Improvement:** After project delivery, reflect on what worked and what could be improved.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Document solutions and share learnings with the team to raise the collective standard.

### Practical Example

When introducing a new library, take time to understand its limitations, typical failure modes, and integration points—not just its headline features. Then, document your findings for others who may use it in the future.

## Purpose

### Definition

Purpose means understanding not only what you are building, but **why** it matters. Engineers must connect their daily tasks to broader business objectives and customer needs.

### Rationale

- **Motivation:** Clear purpose increases engagement and satisfaction.
- **Decision-Making:** Knowledge of the wider goal guides technical trade-offs.
- **Ownership of Outcomes:** Linking work to real-world impact sharpens focus on value.

### Expectations

- **Seek Context:** Proactively clarify the business case, usage, and success metrics of your work.
- **Challenge Assumptions:** If a requirement appears misaligned with objectives, raise questions.
- **Measure Impact:** Where possible, evaluate your work using defined success criteria (e.g., user engagement, system reliability).

### Practical Example

If tasked with improving service response times, find out how speed affects user satisfaction or business revenue. Focus on optimisations that improve those real-world outcomes, not just technical metrics.

## Context-Driven Judgement

### Definition

Context-driven judgement is the disciplined application of engineering principles tailored to the current situation. Rather than rigidly applying rules, engineers should interpret guidelines in light of business priorities, risk, and constraints.

### Rationale

- **Pragmatism:** Not all decisions have the same impact; proportionality prevents over-engineering or needless process.
- **Alignment:** Solutions tailored to context are more likely to achieve desired outcomes efficiently.
- **Resilience:** Adapts well to ambiguity, legacy constraints, and variable team capacities.

### Expectations

- **Assess Trade-Offs:** For any decision, weigh benefits against risks and resource costs.
- **Escalate Appropriately:** When context suggests a standard approach will not suffice, consult stakeholders early.
- **Document Reasoning:** Record the rationale behind any context-specific deviation from standard practice.

### Practical Example

For a prototype, it may be appropriate to prioritise speed over robustness—while clearly marking the code as non-production and capturing future technical debt. Conversely, a core banking module requires rigorous testing and documentation, regardless of delivery pressure.

## Applying the Principles

- Before starting, clarify both the technical and business context.
- Take ownership of your work, but remain communicative and open to feedback.
- Invest in your ongoing development, and help those around you do the same.
- Always tailor your approach proportionally to the situation at hand.

Use these principles as your foundation for day-to-day decisions and long-term professional growth.
