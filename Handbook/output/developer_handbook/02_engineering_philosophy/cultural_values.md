# Cultural Values

Our engineering culture is anchored around three core values: psychological safety, craftsmanship, and healthy collaboration. Together, these principles ensure that our teams can work efficiently, learn continuously, and deliver robust solutions. This page describes each value, explains its importance, details actionable expectations, and provides practical examples where helpful.

## Psychological Safety

### What Is Psychological Safety?

Psychological safety exists when team members feel their contributions and opinions are valued, and they are comfortable taking interpersonal risks—such as proposing new ideas, asking questions, or admitting mistakes—without fear of negative consequences.

### Why It Matters

Psychological safety is a prerequisite for high-performing teams. Without it, people hesitate to share knowledge or raise concerns, leading to missed opportunities, undetected errors, and reduced innovation. Teams with strong psychological safety learn faster, adapt to change more readily, and build trust that sustains performance under pressure.

### How to Practise Psychological Safety

- **Invite Input:** Regularly seek and encourage contributions, especially from quieter team members. For example, at the end of sprint planning, ask: “Has anything been missed or could any aspect be improved?”
- **Respond Constructively:** When someone raises an issue or proposes an idea, acknowledge their contribution professionally—even when you disagree. Avoid dismissive language.
- **Normalise Mistakes:** When mistakes happen, prioritise understanding causes over assigning blame. Use incident reviews to learn without humiliation.
- **Model Vulnerability:** Leaders and senior engineers should admit when they are uncertain or have made mistakes. This sets a precedent for the team.
- **Challenge Respectfully:** Disagreement is welcome but must always be respectful and focused on issues, not individuals.

## Craftsmanship

### What Is Craftsmanship?

Craftsmanship denotes a commitment to producing high-quality, maintainable, and reliable software. It values technical excellence, continuous improvement, and professional responsibility for the output of one’s work.

### Why It Matters

Engineering decisions accrue long-term consequences. Quality built today directly affects reliability, extendibility, and cost of change. Craftsmanship ensures that what we build can be confidently evolved, operated, and supported by ourselves and by future teams.

### How to Apply Craftsmanship

- **Code Quality:** Write clear, purposeful code with proper structure, naming, and documentation. The aim is not perfectionism, but clarity and suitability for current and foreseeable requirements.
- **Quality Gates:** Use code reviews and automated checks not as hurdles, but as opportunities to share knowledge and enforce shared standards.
- **Refactoring:** Proactively improve code, not only when adding features but when maintenance reveals better solutions or the original intent is unclear.
- **Testing:** Ensure all significant logic has appropriate automated coverage. Unit and integration tests protect against regressions and document intent.
- **Own the Outcome:** If defects or outages occur, respond promptly and thoroughly. Take corrective action and share lessons learned with the wider team.

**Example:**  
If you notice unclear method names in shared code, suggest improvements during review rather than accepting ambiguity to “get it done”. Clarity now saves hours of confusion later.

## Healthy Collaboration

### What Is Healthy Collaboration?

Healthy collaboration means working together transparently, constructively, and efficiently towards common goals, regardless of organisational boundaries or experience levels.

### Why It Matters

Complex engineering projects demand knowledge-sharing and collective problem-solving. Healthy collaboration speeds up discovery, prevents duplicated effort, and enables better decisions by surfacing diverse perspectives and expertise.

### How to Foster Healthy Collaboration

- **Information Sharing:** Communicate progress, blockers, and decisions openly—in writing where possible. Avoid information silos.
- **Constructive Disagreement:** Debate ideas robustly, but listen actively to others’ reasoning and remain open to being persuaded.
- **Shared Ownership:** Success and failures are team outcomes. Avoid territorial “my code/my feature” attitudes.
- **Support and Recognition:** Offer help without waiting to be asked and acknowledge others’ contributions publicly.
- **Cross-Functional Engagement:** Involve relevant stakeholders (QA, ops, product, etc.) early in the discussion to gather insights and align expectations.

**Example:**  
During an architecture planning session, invite feedback from both frontend and backend engineers, as well as operations stakeholders. Document agreements and disagreements, and ensure follow-up tasks are visible to all involved.

## Summary of Expectations

- **Prioritise psychological safety:** Make it safe for anyone to speak, question, and challenge.
- **Work with craftsmanship:** Strive for clarity, quality, and pride in what you build.
- **Collaborate healthily:** Communicate, support, and share ownership across boundaries.

These cultural values are essential for effective engineering. Practise them daily, address lapses quickly, and lead by example.
