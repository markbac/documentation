# Onboarding and Learning

## First Month

### Purpose of This Guide

This page outlines a structured learning plan for new engineering team members during their first month. It describes what to learn, why each step is necessary, and how to approach the process, ensuring you build practical competence and a broad contextual understanding from day one.

---

## Objectives for the First Month

1. **Gain functional knowledge of our codebase and tools.**
2. **Understand team workflows, communication channels, and expectations.**
3. **Deliver small yet meaningful contributions safely and independently.**
4. **Establish relationships with teammates and key stakeholders.**

## Week-by-Week Learning Plan

### Week 1: Orientation and Foundations

#### What to Do

- **Complete all induction modules**: Company policies, security standards, health and safety, and compliance training.
- **Set up your development environment**:
  - Install required software (IDEs, version control, build tools).
  - Clone main repositories and run initial builds.
  - Obtain access credentials (VPN, GitHub, internal dashboards).
- **Review key documentation**:
  - **Engineering handbook**: Read the overview, product documentation, and common workflows.
  - **Codebase tour**: Follow the mapped README files to understand repository structure.
- **Meet your onboarding buddy and manager**: Schedule a regular check-in cadence.
- **Familiarise yourself with tools**: Issue tracker, code review systems, communication (e.g., Slack, Teams), and documentation platforms (e.g., Confluence, Notion).

#### Why It Matters

A smooth setup reduces technical friction and anxiety. Early direct contact with systems and people sets the stage for rapid, confident progress. Recognising where key resources and expertise lie enables you to learn efficiently.

#### Example

> If your primary project uses Docker and CI/CD pipelines, ensure you have pulled the latest Docker images and can run the full test suite locally before attempting code changes.

### Week 2: Shadowing and Contextual Learning

#### What to Do

- **Shadow team rituals**:
  - Join stand-ups, sprint plannings, and code reviews as an observer.
- **Pair programming**:
  - Sit in on at least two sessions. Take notes on workflow, decision-making, and tools used.
- **Trace a feature from ticket to deployment**:
  - Select a recently shipped change. Follow it from user story, through implementation, code review, testing, and release.
- **Dive deeper into architecture**:
  - Study high-level architecture diagrams.
  - Identify main services, their roles, data flows, and external dependencies.

#### Why It Matters

Understanding not just *what* happens but *how* and *why* processes work helps you form a mental model of the team's operational rhythms. Following a real feature through the workflow grounds theory in observed reality.

#### Example

> If the team uses pull requests (PRs) for all changes, follow a closed PR: examine the description, linked ticket, review comments, test plan, and deployment notes.

### Week 3: Guided Contribution

#### What to Do

- **Identify a starter issue**:
  - Choose a low-risk ticket (e.g., minor bug, documentation update) with help from your buddy or lead.
- **Make your first commit and pull request**:
  - Follow branching, commit message, and PR guidelines meticulously.
- **Request feedback**:
  - Proactively ask for thorough code reviews.
  - Act on review comments promptly.
- **Document learnings**:
  - Note steps taken, issues encountered, and how they were resolved, either in a shared log or a personal journal.

#### Why It Matters

Early contributions build confidence and clarify the team’s definition of done. Practising the full cycle (from ticket grooming to deployment) prepares you to incrementally take on more complex tasks.

#### Example

> Fixing a spelling mistake in user-facing documentation or updating a dependency in the build script are typical first commits.

---

### Week 4: Independent Practice and Reflection

#### What to Do

- **Tackle a slightly more complex task**:
  - E.g., a non-trivial bug fix or small feature, under light supervision.
- **Perform peer code reviews**:
  - Review at least one PR from another engineer, following the team’s review checklist.
- **Request feedback from your manager and buddy**:
  - Discuss what has gone well, where you feel blocked, and areas for improvement.
- **Reflect and set learning goals**:
  - Write a summary of what you’ve learned and identify next steps for your growth.

#### Why It Matters

Applying knowledge independently is a key transition from onboarding to contributing. Reviewing a peer’s code highlights team norms and deepens your understanding. Reflection ensures you consolidate knowledge and proactively address gaps.

#### Example

> Successfully implementing a minor validation rule in an API endpoint and seeing it promoted to staging or production.

## Expectations and Key Principles

- **Ask questions early**. Flag confusion rather than delay progress. No question is too basic.
- **Read and reference documentation** before escalating issues.
- **Prioritise safe, incremental learning**. Do not rush major changes without understanding their impact.
- **Record and share onboarding pain points**. This helps improve the process for the next joining engineer.
