# Mentorship

## Purpose

Mentorship is a structured relationship where an experienced team member (mentor) supports the development of a less experienced colleague (mentee). Well-defined mentorship directly accelerates onboarding, strengthens technical competence, and fosters a productive, collaborative culture.

This guidance sets clear expectations for both mentors and mentees at all stages of engagement, ensuring effective and mutually beneficial outcomes.

## 1. Role of the Mentor

### 1.1 Responsibilities

Mentors are accountable for:

- **Providing Context:** Explain how the team operates, relevant systems, and historical decisions that guide current processes.
- **Demonstrating Practical Skills:** Show best practices, code conventions, documentation standards, and usage of engineering tools.
- **Answering Questions:** Respond to queries promptly, even if that means signposting to the right person or resource.
- **Giving Structured Feedback:** Offer actionable insights on work output, reasoning, and approach, including positive reinforcement and constructive criticism.
- **Modelling Professional Behaviour:** Demonstrate effective communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, setting tangible examples for the mentee to follow.
- **Identifying Development Opportunities:** Suggest learning paths or activities aligned with the mentee’s role and growth objectives.

#### Example

A mentor notices a mentee has not raised questions after being assigned a deployment task. The mentor proactively schedules a 15-minute walkthrough of the deployment checklist to avoid silent confusion.

### 1.2 Boundaries

Mentors are not expected to:

- Carry out tasks on behalf of the mentee.
- Supervise performance in a line management capacity.
- Offer advice outside their expertise (e.g., HR, personal matters).

If challenges fall outside these boundaries, mentors should signpost the appropriate contact or resource.

## 2. Role of the Mentee

### 2.1 Responsibilities

Mentees are expected to:

- **Be Proactive:** Seek clarification whenever required; do not wait for issues to escalate.
- **Prepare Before Meetings:** Review relevant documentation and attempt tasks independently prior to mentor sessions.
- **Actively Participate:** Drive their own learning by engaging in discussion, requesting feedback, and following up on matters raised.
- **Reflect and Apply Feedback:** Implement feedback received and seek confirmation or iterate as needed.
- **Respect the Mentor’s Time:** Arrange sessions considerately, arrive punctually, and prepare focused questions or topics.

#### Example

Before a code review, the mentee examines recent commits relating to the feature, notes uncertainties, and prepares questions in advance for the mentor session.

## 3. Structuring the Mentorship Relationship

### 3.1 Goals and Check-Ins

Both parties must agree on the mentorship objectives, such as:

- Completing onboarding to all core services within 4 weeks.
- Mastering the deployment pipeline by a specified date.

Regular check-ins (typically weekly, or more frequently during initial onboarding) ensure expectations remain clear and progress is tracked.

### 3.2 Communication

Selecting a primary communication channel (for example, Slack, email, or scheduled meetings) and response expectations (e.g., within one working day) prevents ambiguity. Written follow-ups after key discussions are encouraged for transparency.

### 3.3 Duration

Mentorship for onboarding typically lasts the first 1–3 months, but may be extended depending on project complexity. After official mentorship concludes, informal guidance is encouraged.

## 4. Why Effective Mentorship Matters

- **Accelerates Onboarding:** Reduces the time taken for new engineers to contribute independently.
- **Reduces Rework:** Early feedback and contextual awareness help avoid common mistakes.
- **Promotes Knowledge Sharing:** Prevents siloed information, fostering a more resilient team.
- **Builds Trust:** Regular, open communication between mentor and mentee sets the foundation for future collaboration.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 5.1 Lack of Engagement

If either mentor or mentee is unresponsive or misses meetings, address this directly. If unresolved, escalate to the line manager.

### 5.2 Mismatched Expectations

If goals or boundaries are unclear, reset by revisiting objectives and role definitions (see Sections 1 and 2 above).

## Summary Checklist

- **Mentor:** Provides context, demonstrates skills, gives structured feedback, identifies learning paths; does not overstep into non-mentorship responsibilities.
- **Mentee:** Is proactive, prepares, participates fully, applies feedback, respects mentor’s time.
- **Both:** Set explicit goals, maintain regular check-ins, communicate clearly, and escalate problems early if needed.

Clear expectations and active participation make mentorship a key asset for both onboarding and long-term team growth.
