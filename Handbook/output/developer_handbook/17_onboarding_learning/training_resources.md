# Training Resources

This page details the recommended internal and external training resources for engineering team members. The intent is to ensure all engineers have access to high-quality materials for onboarding, continuous learning, and skill development. These resources have been evaluated for accuracy, relevance, and depth to meet our technical and operational requirements.

## Why Training Resources Matter

Effective training directly impacts both individual and team performance. A well-structured training framework ensures that:

- New team members become productive quickly and align with company standards.
- All engineers have up-to-date knowledge of tools, processes, and industry best practices.
- Consistent approaches are maintained across projects, reducing technical debt and avoidable errors.
- Opportunities for ongoing professional growth are accessible, supporting retention and job satisfaction.

## Internal Training Resources

### 1. Engineering Handbook

**What it is:**  
The primary reference for all internal processes, coding standards, architectural decisions, and operational policies.

**How to use it:**  
- Start with the [Getting Started] and [Project Overview] sections.
- Refer to the [Architecture], [Coding Conventions], and [Deployment] pages when working on relevant tasks.
- Review the [Incident Response] procedures before taking part in on-call duties.

**Why it matters:**  
This handbook codifies the team's agreed practices, reducing ambiguity and onboarding time.

---

### 2. Codebase Walkthrough Sessions

**What it is:**  
Regularly scheduled sessions where experienced engineers guide newer members through core parts of the codebase.

**How to use it:**  
- Attend at least one session in your first two weeks.
- Prepare questions about unfamiliar modules or technology choices.
- Review past session recordings, available on the [Internal Drive > Training > Codebase Walkthroughs].

**Why it matters:**  
Direct exposure accelerates familiarity and establishes patterns for collaboration and code review etiquette.

---

### 3. Technical Onboarding Checklist

**What it is:**  
A step-by-step list of tasks every engineer must complete upon joining, covering environment setup, access, and initial projects.

**How to use it:**  
- Locate the up-to-date checklist in the [Onboarding Resources] folder.
- Complete each section, ticking off items as you progress.
- Consult your onboarding mentor with any questions regarding individual tasks.

**Why it matters:**  
Following the checklist ensures no critical setup or knowledge step is missed, streamlining the onboarding process and reducing errors.

---

### 4. Internal Knowledge Shares and Lunch & Learns

**What it is:**  
Scheduled presentations or workshops where team members share expertise on technical topics, recent projects, or lessons learned.

**How to use it:**  
- Attend sessions relevant to your role or interests.
- Review presentation materials archived on the [Internal Wiki > Knowledge Shares] page.

**Why it matters:**  
These sessions foster knowledge transfer, prevent siloed expertise, and encourage continuous improvement.

---

## External Training Resources

### 1. Technical Documentation and API References

**What it is:**  
Official documentation from language, framework, or cloud service providers (e.g., Python docs, AWS Documentation).

**How to use it:**  
- Reference directly when implementing or troubleshooting features dependent on third-party tools.
- Bookmark the main docs pages for technologies core to your role.

**Why it matters:**  
Provider documentation is the authoritative source for behaviour, ensuring accuracy when developing or debugging.

*Example:*  
When integrating with AWS S3, always consult the [AWS S3 Developer Guide] for proper API usage.

---

### 2. Online Courses (Curated)

**What it is:**  
Pre-approved courses covering essential skills, such as system design, security best practices, or CI/CD pipelines.

**How to use it:**  
- Access the list of recommended courses on the [Internal Wiki > Training > External Courses].
- Complete courses relevant to your project domain or responsibilities.
- Share certificates or reports of completion with your line manager.

**Why it matters:**  
External courses provide tailored, in-depth learning which supplements internal knowledge, especially where niche expertise is required.

---

### 3. Industry Publications and Best Practice Guides

**What it is:**  
Curated list of technical blogs, standards documents, and whitepapers aligned to our stack and engineering culture.

**How to use it:**  
- Set aside regular time (e.g., fortnightly) to read selected materials.
- Reference published best practices when proposing architectural or process changes.

**Why it matters:**  
Staying current with respected industry sources helps anticipate trends, understand rationale behind standard patterns, and improve technical decision-making.

*Example:*  
When suggesting a service migration, review the [Twelve-Factor App Methodology] to justify design choices.

---

## Expectations and Application

- **Engagement**: All engineers are expected to make active use of the resources listed above as part of ongoing professional development.
- **Contribution**: Identifying gaps or outdated content in internal resources should be flagged to your mentor or the documentation lead.
- **Documentation**: Share insights from training with the team, either through informal discussion or scheduled knowledge sharing.
- **Balance**: External materials should supplement, not override, our internal conventions and tech stack policies.

---

## Summary

Effective use of both internal and external training resources enables engineers to on-board efficiently, build robust systems, and contribute to a high-performing, collaborative environment. Always refer to the latest version of this page and notify the documentation team of any issues or suggestions for new resources.
