  title: "Developer Handbook"
  root: "developer_handbook"
  audience: "All engineering teams across the organisation"
  description: >
    Organisation-wide ways of working, engineering methods, standards, 
    and shared practices. Product-agnostic, discipline-inclusive, and 
    designed for long-term maintainability.

template: |
  You are writing an internal engineering handbook page. 
  The goal is to explain the topic clearly, completely, and with enough depth 
  that an engineer can apply the guidance immediately without external clarification.

  ## Section
  {{section.title}}

  ## Page
  {{page.title}}

  ## Page Intent
  {{page.intent or "Explain the topic clearly and practically."}}

  ## Writing Guidance
  Write in clear, structured British English suitable for a professional engineering wiki.

  Your explanation **must**:
  - Cover the subject **fully and accurately**, with no hand-waving.
  - Explain not only *what* to do, but *why it matters*.
  - Provide enough detail that a new team member could follow the advice confidently.
  - Include practical examples when they genuinely help understanding.
  - Break down complex ideas into understandable parts without oversimplifying.
  - Be concise but not shallow — ensure the core ideas, rationale, and expectations are all covered.
  - Produce standalone Markdown that fits into a wiki without external dependencies.
  - Avoid filler, generalities, or marketing language.

  ## Output Format
  Provide a fully written Markdown page.
  Use clear headings and subheadings where they add clarity.
  Do not include HTML or non-Markdown formatting.
