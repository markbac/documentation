  You are writing a section of a cohesive engineering book titled:
  "{{book.title}}".

  This section must be written in continuous, mature, narrative prose—
  similar in tone and structure to a professional engineering textbook.
  Avoid list-heavy summaries unless they are genuinely the strongest way
  to present information. The default style should be paragraphs that develop
  ideas logically, using subheadings where useful.

  ## Book Audience
  {{book.audience}}

  ## Book Context
  {{book.description}}

  ## Previous Chapters Summary (for narrative and conceptual continuity)
  {{previous_summary}}

  ## Upcoming Chapters Outline (to avoid repetition and pre-empting)
  {{future_outline}}

  ## Current Chapter Intent
  {{chapter.intent}}

  ## Current Section Summary
  {{section.summary}}

  ## Narrative Writing Requirements
  Write this section as a genuine part of a book chapter:
    - Use structured paragraphs and clear subheadings.
    - Develop ideas through explanation, comparison, and reasoning rather than lists.
    - Use lists sparingly, only where they meaningfully improve clarity.
    - Avoid instructional bullet-point formats (e.g. “Purpose / Autonomy / Mastery”).
    - Maintain a steady narrative voice suitable for an engineering textbook.
    - Use technical precision, but keep the flow suitable for long-form reading.
    - Avoid conversational tone, anecdotes, or “tips”.
    - Avoid marketing language, hype, or subjective claims.

  ## Technical Exposition Requirements
    - Define core ideas clearly and place them in their correct context.
    - Explain mechanisms, behaviours, and architectural concepts at the required depth.
    - Describe practical realities such as workflow, constraints, assumptions,
      trade-offs, and variations.
    - Reference relevant standards, frameworks, and engineering norms when appropriate.
    - Ensure strict consistency with terminology and explanations introduced earlier.

  ## Section Formatting Requirements
    - The section must begin with a single top-level heading:
      # {{section.title}}
    - Do not include any YAML front matter or lines beginning with '---'.
    - After the opening H1 heading, you may freely use lower-level headings
      (##, ###, ####) as appropriate to structure the narrative.
    - Do not place any other heading above level 1.

  ## Mermaid Diagram Rules (Strict)
  When a diagram would improve understanding and can be expressed using Mermaid,
  include a valid Mermaid diagram. Requirements:
    - Only create diagrams that conform to official Mermaid grammar.
    - Only use supported link/arrow types.
    - Do not invent arrow styles or combine unsupported syntactic patterns.
    - Wrap node titles in square brackets, e.g. NodeA[Client Device].
    - Use simple, correct label syntax.
    - Avoid unsupported characters or link operators.
    - Do not describe a diagram in prose if it can be represented in Mermaid.
    - If a concept cannot be diagrammed in Mermaid, suggest the most relevant
      alternative visual (e.g., timing diagram, conceptual illustration).

  ## Practical Engineering Considerations
    - Highlight real integration points, architectural or organisational implications,
      trade-offs, failure modes, and lifecycle realities.
    - Incorporate the types of considerations an engineer would need to apply this
      knowledge in practice.

  Target length: {{section.length}} words. This is a target, adjust as neccessary to ensure sufficient depth and clarity.
