template: |
  You are generating a Markdown document.  
  The final output MUST begin with the YAML front-matter shown below.  
  Output the YAML front-matter exactly as rendered by this template.  
  Do NOT modify field names.  
  Do NOT explain the front-matter.  
  After the front-matter, write the full document content.

  --- 
  title: "{{topic}}"
  summary: "{{summary}}"
  category: "{{category}}"
  sub_category: "{{ sub_category | default("") }}"
  tags:
    {% for tag in tags %}
    - "{{tag}}"
    {% endfor %}
  related_topics:
    {% for r in related %}
    - "{{r}}"
    {% endfor %}
  ---

  Begin your Markdown document **immediately after** the YAML front-matter above.

  Produce a formal, textbook-style {{doc_type}} that introduces {{audience}} to the topic "{{topic}}".

  Depth: {{depth}}
  Audience: {{audience}}
  Document Type: {{doc_type}}
  Topic: {{topic}}
  Summary guidance: "{{summary}}"

  Target Length: {{length}} words (approximate), or whatever length is required to sufficiently convey the topic with clarity and completeness.

  Use the summary for context but do not repeat it verbatim unless appropriate.

  Provide a clear, structured explanation, but choose the structure appropriate to the topic rather than following a fixed outline.

  The document should:

    - Define the topic clearly and place it in the correct technical context.
    - Explain core concepts, key components, and relevant architecture at the specified depth.
    - Describe how the technology works in practice, including typical workflows, constraints, assumptions, and common variations.
    - Reference relevant standards, RFCs, protocols, or specifications where appropriate, without including a further-reading section.

    - Whenever the explanation would benefit from a diagram that can be represented in Mermaid, PlantUML, or similar with descriptive explanatory names
      (such as block diagrams, system overviews, flowcharts, sequence/call-flow diagrams, state diagrams, or simple architecture diagrams),
      generate an actual Mermaid diagram with a descriptive explanatory name.

      All Mermaid diagrams must be syntactically valid and conform to official Mermaid grammar.
      Only use supported arrow and link types.
      When labelling edges, use standard Mermaid syntax such as A --> B, A -->|Label| B, A -.-> B, or A -. Label .-> B.
      Do not invent custom arrow styles or combine dotted lines with labels in unsupported ways.
      Keep edge labels simple and avoid quotes, colons, or special punctuation that may break parsing.
      Wrap node titles in square brackets where appropriate (e.g., NodeA[Client Device]).
      Do not output diagrams containing unsupported characters or invalid link operators.
      Do not describe diagrams in prose when they can be expressed in Mermaid.
      Only omit a diagram if the concept genuinely cannot be expressed as Mermaid.

    - Suggest other helpful visuals when appropriate.  
      Use a **Note** admonition for “diagram to be added later” placeholders.

    - Use GitHub Alerts (admonitions) to highlight important notes, cautions, tips, or warnings.

    - Highlight practical engineering considerations such as integration points, performance implications, implementation challenges, common pitfalls, and typical engineering decisions.

    - Remain formal, technical, and objective throughout.

    - Avoid marketing language, opinion, or unnecessary narrative.

    - Keep explanations accurate, structured, coherent, and suitable for engineers approaching the topic for the first time.
